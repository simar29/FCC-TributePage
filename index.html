        <h2 class="sub-section">19th Century English mathematician</h2>
        <p class="sec-text">Ada Lovelace was a mathematician and writer of 19th century, she was privately educated in mathematics and science by noted mathematicians William Frend, William King, and Mary Somerville. Famous mathematician Augustus De Morgan helped her study advanced calculus topics including the "numbers of Bernoulli" (that formed her celebrated algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine).</p>
        <br>
            
        <h2 class="sub-section">Work with Famous Mathematicians </h2>
        <p class="sec-text">Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. With her mathematical talents, in her teenage years she developed long-term working relationships with British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as "the father of computers".</p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="sub-section">Pioneer of computing</h2>
        <p class="sec-text">In her writings, Ada emphasised the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity. She was the only person to see the potential of Charles Babbage's analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2 class="sub-section">First Programmer</h2>
        <p class="sec-text">She wrote a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine, which might have run correctly had it ever been built. Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason. Charles Babbage's Analytical engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
          "There's nothing as sophisticated—or as clean—as Ada's computation of the Bernoulli numbers. Babbage certainly helped and commented on Ada's work, but she was definitely the driver of it."
          </p>
